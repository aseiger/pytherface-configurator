Protocols work as follows:

Config files are used to define messages and the values that originate and
Leave from the target device. Message direction is always assumed as coming
*from* the embedded device and to the PC.

MESSAGE DEFENITION SYNTAX:
YAML List. All *must* have a type, defined below. if message is an incoming or
outgoing message, it also must have a variables section

variables can have a type, unit, and scaling factor associated with them. If
Unit or Scale are omitted, they are kept blank

- DataUpdate:
  type: incoming
  variables:
    - AirPressure:
      type: uint32_t
      unit: mPa
      scale: 100
    - AirTemperature:
      type: uint32_t
      unit: C
      scale: 10
    - Occupancy:
      type: boolean



message types:
INCOMING MESSAGES - Embedded Device ---> PC
  - incoming
OUTGOING MESSAGES - PC ---> Embedded Device
